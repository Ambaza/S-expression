# S-expression
Basic S-expression parser in Python. We'll define a few functions to handle S-expressions, and we'll keep it simple by supporting only basic arithmetic operations
This parser can handle basic arithmetic expressions within S-expressions. It tokenizes the input expression and recursively parses the tokens, building a nested structure that represents the S-expression.
